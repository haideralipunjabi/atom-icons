# How to Contribute

## Making Icons
* You only need to submit an SVG file per icon, other formats will be generated using CI.
* You may use [icon.svg](icon.svg) or any other SVG file from the repository as a base/reference.
* Make sure the `width` & `height` attributes are removed from the SVG, they cause problems when resizing the SVG into other formats.
* Ideal size for the icon is `512x512`.

## Naming Guidelines
* If you are submitting the icon as part of a series, make sure to name it like `seriesname_iconname.svg`. No other `underscore (_)` should be used.
* If you are submitting the icon without it being a part of any series, make sure to name it without any `underscore (_)`.

## Notes
* You don't need to edit the README.md, as it is auto generated using CI.
